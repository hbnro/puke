I did mean coup√©
================

Many years ago CoffeeKup was born, we have lots of template engines now.

Well, I made this just for the "why not?" and inspired by the Markaby pattern, actually less sexy on PHP.

Of course, shall be installed as dependency using the Composer.

Basic usage
-----------

Display your favorite books.

    <?php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $data = [
      [
        'author' => 'Hernando de Soto',
        'title' => 'The Mystery of Capitalism'
      ],
      [
        'author' => 'Henry Hazlitt',
        'title' => 'Economics in One Lesson'
      ],
      [
        'author' => 'Milton Friedman',
        'title' => 'Free to Choose'
      ],
    ];

    # painless
    $view = function () {
      if ($books) {
        table(function () {
          tr(function () {
            th('Author');
            th('Title');
          });
          foreach ($books as $key => $val) {
            tr(function () {
              td($val['author']);
              td($val['title']);
            });
          }
        });
      } else {
        p('There are no books to display.');
      }
    };

    # or using a clean render() helper...
    echo Puke\Base::render($view, ['books' => $data]);

Note that a simple echo will not work as normally, use the `text()` helper inside
the template to achieve the same result.

Eval is evil but seriously here he is the king.

Finally

There is not much to say, if you want contribute you're welcome buddy.
